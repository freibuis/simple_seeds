`db/simple_seeds/README.md`  
`db/simple_seeds/simple_seeds.rb` this file loads custom confiruations required by your project accross environments

environments directories:  
`db/simple_seeds/environments/all/` this directory
`db/simple_seeds/environments/{Rails environments}/` each environment listed in your projects environments will be created


### Running simple_seeds

when running `rails db:seed` simple_seeds will automatically run after the rails seed file has completed

## Seed Files

seed files run in filename order from both the :all and your selected rails environment.

`development/001_users.rb`

the `all/001_users.rb` file will run first

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
